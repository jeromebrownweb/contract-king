# Overview - Working with a Senior UI/UX Designer

## Project Details
- **Project**: Job board website (Contract King)
- **Tech Stack**: React + Vite
- **Business Model**: Employers create accounts and pay fees to post jobs
- **Design**: Complete UI designs available in Figma
- **Repository**: https://github.com/jeromebrownweb/contract-king (Public)

## About Me
- Senior UI/UX designer specializing in websites, web apps, and mobile apps using Figma
- **Coding Experience**: Basic HTML/CSS, very little JavaScript knowledge
- **Need Help With**: Front-end implementation and especially backend code/logic (my weakest area)

## How I Work
- **Design-First**: I provide Figma designs for you to build from
- **Learning**: I rely on you to write code but want explanations of what the code does
- **Communication**: Keep responses short and explain everything simply
- **Process**: When I request features/fixes/changes:
  1. You explain your plan first
  2. I approve the plan
  3. Then you execute the code

## Development Workflow
- **Version Control**: Save to git first before building features
- **Safety Net**: If features break heavily, we revert back to previous working version
- **Iterative**: Build one feature at a time, test, then move to next

## Git & GitHub Workflow
- **"Git commit"** = Local save only (frequent during work sessions)
- **"Git push"** = Upload to GitHub (end of day or when ready to publish)
- **Repository**: Connected to GitHub for backup and portfolio showcase
- **Branching**: Work on main branch unless building experimental features

## Authentication Plan
- **Backend**: Supabase for authentication and database
- **Approach**: Build auth system first before adding job posting features
- **Strategy**: React Context for state management, protected routes for employer pages
- **Storage**: Smart file management with 1MB CV limits to stay within free tiers

## What I Need From You
- Handle both front-end and back-end development
- Explain code functionality in simple terms
- Provide implementation plans before coding
- Keep explanations concise and beginner-friendly
- Follow the git commit (local) vs git push (GitHub) workflow
