# Overview - Working with a Senior UI/UX Designer

## Project Details
- **Project**: Job board website
- **Tech Stack**: React + Vite
- **Business Model**: Employers create accounts and pay fees to post jobs
- **Design**: Complete UI designs available in Figma

## About Me
- Senior UI/UX designer specializing in websites, web apps, and mobile apps using Figma
- **Coding Experience**: Basic HTML/CSS, very little JavaScript knowledge
- **Need Help With**: Front-end implementation and especially backend code/logic (my weakest area)

## How I Work
- **Design-First**: I provide Figma designs for you to build from
- **Learning**: I rely on you to write code but want explanations of what the code does
- **Communication**: Keep responses short and explain everything simply
- **Process**: When I request features/fixes/changes:
  1. You explain your plan first
  2. I approve the plan
  3. Then you execute the code

## Development Workflow
- **Version Control**: Save to git first before building features
- **Safety Net**: If features break heavily, we revert back to previous working version
- **Iterative**: Build one feature at a time, test, then move to next

## What I Need From You
- Handle both front-end and back-end development
- Explain code functionality in simple terms
- Provide implementation plans before coding
- Keep explanations concise and beginner-friendly
