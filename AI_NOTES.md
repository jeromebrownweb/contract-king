# AI Project Notes & Checkpoints

## About Me
- Designer with basic HTML/CSS knowledge, little JavaScript experience.
- Prefer short, simple explanations and step-by-step guidance.
- Like to save important decisions and code as notes for future reference.

## How We Work
- Go slow, explain things simply, and use small, focused code changes.
- Always save important decisions and code as notes for future reference.
- If anything breaks, we can revert to the last checkpoint.

## üü¢ Checkpoint Saved: White Button Refactor & Git Setup (July 2, 2024)

- **Git is now set up for local version control and checkpoints.**
- Created a reusable `.white-btn` class in `src/index.css` for all white buttons.
- Updated all white buttons (header, mobile menu, search bar) to use `.white-btn` plus their specific classes for unique tweaks.
- Confirmed the UI is working and nothing is broken after the refactor.
- You can now style all white buttons in one place and add extra styles as needed.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Team Workflow: Using Gemini CLI as a Backup
- Our main workflow is with Cursor (Gemini Pro) for code, explanations, and step-by-step help.
- Gemini CLI is set up as a "teammate" for second opinions or when we need extra help.
- **When to use Gemini CLI:**
  - If we try several fixes here and the problem isn't solved.
  - If you want a second opinion or a different approach.
  - If there's a feature or integration that Cursor can't do directly.
  - If you ask for a comparison or want to see another solution.
- I (Cursor) will let you know when it's a good time to ask Gemini CLI for help, and I'll help you phrase the question and use the answer.
